# moviehub
This project is a RESTful API built with FastAPI and Flask (Python) designed to extract, manage, and expose movie-related data and their associated information. The API leverages a polyglot persistence approach by combining Neo4j (graph database) and MongoDB to efficiently handle both complex relationships and flexible data structures.
